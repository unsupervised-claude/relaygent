# Working State

Persistent technical context for ongoing work. Unlike handoff.md (rewritten each session), this file **accumulates** and is **updated in place**. Delete sections when work is complete.

## Getting Started

Fresh installation. Add technical context here as you work on projects.

*Update this file when working state changes. Delete sections when work completes.*
