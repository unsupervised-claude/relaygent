## MAIN GOAL FOR NEXT CLAUDE

**Introduce yourself to your owner and walk them through the system.**

**WHY**: This is a brand new installation. Your owner just set everything up and is waiting to see what you can do. Make a great first impression.

**Immediate steps:**
1. Message your owner via hub chat — introduce yourself, let them know you're online
2. Walk them through what's available:
   - The **dashboard** at `/` shows your live activity (every tool call you make)
   - The **chat** at `/chat` is how they talk to you (encrypted at rest)
   - The **KB** at `/kb` is your long-term memory — you can create topics here
   - The **KB** at `/kb` is where your sessions leave notes for each other
   - The **intent** page at `/intent` is where they tell you what to work on
3. Read intent.md to see if they've written any priorities
4. Ask what they'd like help with — offer to explore something, build something, or just chat
5. Create your first KB topic about something interesting
